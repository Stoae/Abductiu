## NAM
Neural Additive Models (NAMs) combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees. They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models in accuracy, but can be more easily applied to real-world problems.

## EBM
EBM is a glassbox model indented to have comparable accuracy to machine learning models such as Random Forest and Boosted Trees as well as interpretability capabilities. EBM is a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) which is very similar to linear models.EBM offers some improvements to traditional GAMs: each feature function is learned using modern machine learning technique such as bagging and boosting. Training is carried out in many iterations where each iteration consists of constructing a boosting procedure separately for each feature. As this is done with low learning rates, the order of the features does not matter. The high number of iterations aims to mitigate the effects of co-linearity in order to learn best what is the contribution of each feature to the modelâ€™s prediction. Furthermore, EBM can automatically detect and include pairwise interaction terms, this increases the accuracy of the model while preserving its explainability. Since EBM is an additive model, the contribution of each feature can be captured and visualized, and therefore enhance explainability.

## XGB
XGB is a scalable and highly accurate implementation of gradient boosting that pushes the limits of computing power for boosted tree algorithms, being built largely for energizing machine learning model performance and computational speed. With XGB, trees are built in parallel, instead of sequentially like GBDT. It follows a level-wise strategy, scanning across gradient values and using these partial sums to evaluate the quality of splits at every possible split in the training set.

## Spline
Spline Regression is a non-parametric regression technique. This regression technique divides the datasets into bins at intervals or points called knots and each bin has its separate fit.
